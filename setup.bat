:: setup.bat - the ONE script to run once, per machine, after cloning.
::
:: Adapts the project to the local machine: Python venv + deps, the installed
:: XC32 compiler version, pyOCD (for flashing), and the SAME54_DFP debug fix.
:: It drives batch\setup_venv.bat / install.bat / batch\genmk.bat for you -
:: those exist as separate files because other scripts also call them, but
:: you should never need to run them directly yourself. After this:
::
::   build.bat
::   flash.bat
::
:: The only other script you run directly, and only when it applies: switching
:: which board flash.bat programs, via "install.bat --select" (see 3/5 below).
::
:: Connect the board via its USB debugger port BEFORE running this so the
:: probe check can detect it. Steps are independent: a failure in one is
:: reported but does not abort the rest.
