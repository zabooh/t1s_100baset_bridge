  Raw Ethernet frame test on eth0, bypassing the TCP/IP stack

  File Name:
    noip_test.h

  Summary:
    Sends and counts raw Ethernet frames with EtherType 0x88B5 straight through
    the LAN865x driver, with no IP, ARP, DHCP or socket involved.

  Description:
    "NoIP" is the deliberate absence of the IP stack. A frame goes from this
    module directly into DRV_LAN865X_SendRawEthFrame(), so what appears on the
    two-wire bus is exactly what was assembled here - fixed length, fixed
    payload, a monotonic sequence number, and a caller-chosen inter-frame gap.

    That determinism is the point. It makes the module useful for:

      - reproducible oscilloscope captures: a known frame every N milliseconds,
        with none of the ARP/DHCP/retransmit traffic a socket would add
      - separating "the bus works" from "the IP configuration works" when
        something does not come through
      - loss counting over long runs, since TX and RX counters are independent
        of any protocol state

    EtherType 0x88B5 is reserved by IEEE 802 for local experimental use, so the
    frames are guaranteed not to collide with a real protocol, and Wireshark
    shows them without trying to dissect them as something else.

  What is here and what is not:
    This module owns everything specific to the test: the EtherType, the frame
    layout, the counters, the console commands and the wording of its output.

    It does NOT own the deferred packet log. Printing from a receive handler is
    not safe, so received frames are queued in the application's log ring buffer
    (shared with the ipdump paths) and printed later from the main loop. The
    application therefore keeps two small responsibilities: recognising a NoIP
    frame on receive and enqueueing it, and calling NOIP_PrintRxLine() when the
    entry comes back out. See pktEth0Handler() and the log drain in app.c.

    Transmit also calls MIRROR_RawTx() from port_mirror.h after each frame, which
    is what makes these frames visible to Wireshark on eth1 while "mirror 1" is
    on. The raw driver path bypasses the mirror's normal TX hook, so without that
    call a capture stays empty and the mirror looks broken. Dropping the call is
    the only thing needed to make this module independent of port_mirror again.
