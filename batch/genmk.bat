rem genmk.bat - generate the nbproject Makefiles WITHOUT opening MPLAB X IDE.
rem
rem   genmk.bat <project-folder.X>
rem
rem WHY THIS EXISTS
rem MPLAB X derives `nbproject\Makefile-*.mk` from `configurations.xml`, and those
rem fragments are gitignored - rightly so, because they are full of absolute paths
rem of the machine that generated them:
rem
rem   C:/Users/<user>/.mchp_packs/Microchip/SAME54_DFP/3.8.234
rem   C:\Program Files\Microchip\xc32\v4.60\bin
rem
rem Committed, they would be wrong on every other machine - and wrong in the
rem expensive way: the link succeeds, then `xc32-bin2hex` fails with "file not
rem found". So they do not belong in the repo. They still have to exist, though,
rem or a fresh clone cannot build.
rem
rem `prjMakefilesGenerator.bat` is the supported tool MPLAB X ships for exactly
rem this. With it, a new machine needs the IDE INSTALLED, not opened - which
rem retires the old instruction "open and build the project in the IDE once".
rem
rem MEASURED 2026-08-18 in a fresh clone: fragments deleted, generator run
rem (rc=0, five files), then `build.bat` reported BUILD SUCCESSFUL with a HEX of
rem 580 034 bytes - bit-identical to the one from the set-up folder.
